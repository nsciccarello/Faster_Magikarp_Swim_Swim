# Faster, Magikarp! Swim, swim!

I created a Flappy Bird-based game called "Faster, Magikarp! Swim! Swim!" It has some of the functionality 
as the original Flappy Bird but with a few differences. Here, the player is a Magikarp (a water-type Pok√©mon that's basically a fish) and the goal is to swim through as many pipes as possible without hitting any. I created this with vanilla JavaScript,
no libraries. All sprites, sound effects, and background images are from online public databases,
and they're royalty-free and do not require credit.

* Press the "S" or DOWN button to swim down.
* Don't hit any of the pipes!
